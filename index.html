Hey, thanks for taking the time to look at my code!

There's actually more content on this resume than meets the eye, if you care
to look; many of my personal projects are described but marked as "hidden" due
to the space constraints of one page.

If you want to see them, use the developer mode inspector on Safari or Chrome
to either delete the "--hidden-display" property or change its value to "initial."
Formatting may be quite bad, however, as the website's designed for one page; be warned!
