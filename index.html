				<h4>Used <span class="java">Java</span></h4>
				<p>Designed, created and updated a fully-functioning and scalable 2D game engine from the ground up using AWT/Swing in Java. Led a four-person team to 2nd place at an international-level competition (TSA Video Game Design/Programming) using a game built with that engine.</p>

				<h4>Used <span class="html">HTML</span>, <span class="css">CSS</span>, and <span class="javascript">JavaScript</span></h4>
				<p>Worked with end users to design, test, and iterate a successfully deployed web application while matching a set of given technical specifications. Made it easier for Free Methodist Bible Quizzing teams from remote and lower-income areas to practice without need for a $150+ set of niche hardware by using a computer keyboard and this simple online website instead.</p>

				<h3>Carbon Cycle Simulator <span class="date">(2018)</span> <a href="https://carbon.brennancolberg.com">carbon.brennancolberg.com</a></h3>
				<h4>Used <span class="html">HTML</span>, <span class="css">CSS</span>, and <span class="javascript">JavaScript</span></h4>
				<p>Designed and created an informational website built to emphasize the structure and function of the biological "Carbon Cycle", based on a lesson plan in which I found massive potential for improvement, and worked with teachers to have it put to use in local high school biology classrooms.</p>

				<p>Constantly iterated and improved a simple monitor display (for use alongside the board game "Axis &amp; Allies (1942)") into a web application that can track almost every aspect of an instance of said game, negating the need for paperwork or manual calculations. Worked with cookies to store game data for large pauses in time.</p>

				<h3>Online Periodic Table (2018) <a href="https://periodic-table.brennancolberg.com">periodic-table.brennancolberg.com</a></h3>
				<h4>Primarily used <span class="css">CSS</span> and <span class="javascript">JavaScript</span></h4>
