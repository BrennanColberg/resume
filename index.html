				<h3>BFramework <span class="date">(2016 - 2017)</span></h3>

				<h3>Carbon Cycle Simulator <span class="date">(2018)</span> [<a href="https://carbon.brennancolberg.com">carbon.brennancolberg.com</a>]</h3>
				<p>Designed and created an informational website built to emphasize the structure and function of the biological "Carbon Cycle", based on a lesson plan in which I found massive potential for improvement, and worked with teachers to have it put to use in local high school biology classrooms.</p>

				<h3>Axis &amp; Allies Dashboard <span class="date">(2018)</span> [<a href="https://axis-allies.brennancolberg.com">axis-allies.brennancolberg.com</a>]</h3>
				<p>Constantly iterated and improved a simple monitor display (for use alongside the board game "Axis & Allies (1942)") into a web application that can track almost every aspect of an instance of said game, negating the need for paperwork or manual calculations. Worked with cookie storage across all major browsers to allow games to pause (with all data intact) for up to 30 days.</p>
